                <h4>You’ve worked hard to create your product designs, so Corjl has created several tools that help protect your designs and give you control over how they are used:</h4>
                  <ol class="custom-bullet2">
                  <li><b>You control</b> which fonts customers see and have access to.</li>
                  <li>Don’t want something to be editable? No problem! You can <b>disable objects</b> and choose which elements customers can edit or personalize.</li>
                  <li>In addition, <b>you can include extra images/graphics</b> that customers can choose from to add to their designs.</li>    
                </ol>             
                <h2 class="font-weight-bold mt-50">Customers can demo items before purchasing.</h2>

                <ul class="custom-bullet">
                <li><b>Customers no longer have to wonder if their custom message will fit.</b> 
                  <br>Custom demo links to your Etsy listings and let customers demo items before purchasing!
                </li>
                  <li><b>Don’t worry, customers won’t be able to download anything in the demo feature. </b> 
                  <br>Additionally, you can include a default watermark, or even add your own custom watermark!
