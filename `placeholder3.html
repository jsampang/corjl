                <h2 class="font-weight-bold">Download multiple copies or just one.</h2>
                <h4>In Corjl, you/your customers can personalize one label and then  download with multiple copies onto the same page as a PDF. This saves time from having to personalize the same item over and over. </h4>
                <h4>You can also download just one label as a JPG or transparent PNG. This is handy if you’ll be using the labels or tags for a certain template in another program. </h4>
                
                <h2 class="font-weight-bold mt-50">Works for both printed and digital tags and labels.</h2>
                <h4>Whether you print and ship items to customers or let customers download and print, Corjl will work for you! </h4>
                <h4>If selling digital files, you can allow customers to download and print their items after editing, plus choose which formats they can use when downloading (PDF, JPG or PNG). </h4>
                <h4>If selling printed labels or tags, you can set up an item so that customers won’t see the option to download and print after personalizing. Instead, they will mark their item as complete, then you’ll be able to see which items are ready to process.</h4>
